# CentaurNoMore

A Hades II mod to disable the centaur card by changing it's auto activation requirement. Meant to be a vanilla-ish way to disable the card for antler builds or if you just personally hate the card.

## Features

- Wow.
- No more centaur card!
  - No worries about having to adjust arcana cards just so it doesnt insert itself into there!

## Install

Follow instructions on Hell 2 Modding's readme.

## Usage

Works automatically. Disable the mod if you want the card to be useful again.
